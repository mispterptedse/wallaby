- The principle of risk-return trade-off: Managers must weigh the expected return of an investment against the risk involved.
- The principle of time value of money: Money received today is worth more than money received in the future because it can be invested to earn interest.
- The principle of diversification: Managers can reduce risk by spreading their investments across different assets, industries, or markets.
- The principle of financial markets efficiency: Financial markets reflect all available information and adjust quickly to new information.
