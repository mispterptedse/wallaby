There are different sources for downloading the English commentary patch for PES 6, such as [ultigamerz](https://www.ultigamerz.com/2020/03/pes-6-english-commentary-official.html), [PESNewupdate](https://www.pesnewupdate.com/2018/07/pes-6-fifa-english-commentary.html), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/926683480819118/posts/download-patchpes-6-fifa-english-commentaryif-youre-bored-with-the-old-pes-6-eng/1116626915158106/). You can choose the one that suits your preference, but the installation process is similar for all of them.
 
Here are the steps to install the English commentary patch for PES 6:
 
1. Make a backup of your installed commentary file in the following destination: C:\Program Files (x86)\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 6\dat (or something like that) The file's name will have this kind of name: x\_sound.afs (for example e\_sound or f\_sound.afs) [^1^]
2. Download the English commentary patch from one of the sources mentioned above. The file will be in a compressed format, such as .rar or .zip. You will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Put the new commentary file at the same PES 6 destination folder as the original one. This is usually at a destination like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 6\dat [^1^]
4. If, for example, you have installed PES 6 in French language (so you maybe have an f\_sound.afs file), and the new commentary file you just downloaded is e\_sound.afs, then just rename the new one in f\_sound.afs [^1^]
5. Run the game and enjoy the English commentary.

Note: Some patches may require a password to extract them. You can find the password on the source website or in the readme file.
 
I hope this helps you to improve your gaming experience with PES 6. Have fun!

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
If you want to change the commentary language to something other than English, you can also find different patches online. For example, you can download the FIFA English Commentary patch for PES 6 by Cesc Fabregas from [PESNewupdate](https://www.pesnewupdate.com/2018/07/pes-6-fifa-english-commentary.html). This patch will give you the same commentary as the FIFA games, which some players may prefer. The installation process is the same as the one described above.
 
Another option is to download the Additional Language Pack for PES 2021 from [SoccerFandom](https://www.soccerfandom.com/2021/03/pes-2021-additional-language-pack.html). This pack contains various commentary and text languages for the latest version of PES, but it can also work for PES 6. You just need to copy the cpk files to your PES 6 download folder and generate a new DpFileList.bin using DpFileList Generator.
 
However, before you install any patch, make sure that it is compatible with your game version and that it does not conflict with any other mods or patches that you have installed. Also, always backup your original files in case something goes wrong or you want to restore them later.
